    "# Exercise 1 - Simple Data Parallel Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to run simple tasks in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is too slow, and the computation is embarrassingly parallel. In this exercise, you will use Ray to execute the functions in parallel to speed it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept for this Exercise - Remote Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to turn a Python function into a remote function is to add the `@ray.remote` decorator. Here is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A regular Python function.\n",
    "def regular_function():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Ray remote function.\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def remote_function():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invocation:** The regular version is called with `regular_function()`, whereas the remote version is called with `remote_function.remote()`.\n",
    "2. **Return values:** `regular_function` immediately executes and returns `1`, whereas `remote_function` immediately returns an object ID (a future) and then creates a task that will be executed on a worker process. The result can be obtained with `ray.get`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> regular_function()\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> remote_function.remote()\n",
    "    ObjectID(1c80d6937802cd7786ad25e50caf2f023c95e350)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> ray.get(remote_function.remote())\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    for _ in range(4):\n",

    "**Arguments:**\n",
    "- `object_ids`: This is a list of object IDs.\n",
    "- `num_returns`: This is maximum number of object IDs to wait for. The default value is `1`.\n",
    "- `timeout_ms`: This is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait for. So `ray.wait` will block until either `num_returns` objects are ready or until `timeout_ms` milliseconds have passed.\n",

    "**Return values:**\n",
    "- `ready_ids`: This is a list of object IDs that are available in the object store.\n",
    "- `remaining_ids`: This is a list of the IDs that were in `object_ids` but are not in `ready_ids`, so the IDs in `ready_ids` and `remaining_ids` together make up all the IDs in `object_ids`."

    "# Exercise 5 - Introducing Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to create an actor and how to call actor methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the documentation on actors at http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actors.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need a \"worker\" process to have \"state\". For example, that state might be a neural network, a simulator environment, a counter, or something else entirely. However, remote functions are side-effect free. That is, they operate on inputs and produce outputs, but they don't change the state of the worker they execute on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actors are different. When we instantiate an actor, a brand new worker is created, and all methods that are called on that actor are executed on the newly created worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that with a single actor, no parallelism can be achieved because calls to the actor's methods will be executed one at a time. However, multiple actors can be created and methods can be executed on them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts for this Exercise - Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an actor, decorate Python class with the `@ray.remote` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "class Example(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def set(self, x):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get(self):\n",
    "        return self.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like regular Python classes, **actors encapsulate state that is shared across actor method invocations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor classes differ from regular Python classes in the following ways.\n",
    "1. **Instantiation:** A regular class would be instantiated via `e = Example(1)`. Actors are instantiated via\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    e = Example.remote(1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    When an actor is instantiated, a **new worker process** is created by a local scheduler somewhere in the cluster.\n",
    "2. **Method Invocation:** Methods of a regular class would be invoked via `e.set(2)` or `e.get()`. Actor methods are invoked differently.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> e.set.remote(2)\n",
    "    ObjectID(d966aa9b6486331dc2257522734a69ff603e5a1c)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> e.get.remote()\n",
    "    ObjectID(7c432c085864ed4c7c18cf112377a608676afbc3)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Return Values:** Actor methods are non-blocking. They immediately return an object ID and **they create a task which is scheduled on the actor worker**. The result can be retrieved with `ray.get`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> ray.get(e.set.remote(2))\n",
    "    None\n",
